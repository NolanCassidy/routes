  <h1>Routing</h1>
<p>This assignment is due at 5pm on Friday, November 4.  Use
  Canvas to turn in routes.py</p>
<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
  Like “set membership and string reversal,”, this project
  involves recursion; you mainly have to carefully design and
  implement just one recursive function.  
</p>

<h1>Pair Assignment</h1>
  <p>You are encouraged to use <em>pair programming</em> to
  complete this assignment.  You can share code with one other
  classmate, who should be listed as an author in your program
  docstring.  You may discuss general approach and design with other
  students, without sharing code; cite them in your docstring
  clearly distinguishing design discussion from code authorship.
  </p>
  <p>
  The amount of actual programming required for this project is
  small, but be sure you understand how the main program logic works.

<h1>How far to Barad Dur?</h1>
<p>
Suppose you are given a map of a particularly boring country in which
  cities are named a,b,c,d,e,f, and g, with road distances in <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/W6-Routing.php#furlongs">furlongs</a> as follows:
  </p>
<img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-problem.png">
<p>Your program must determine the shortest possible distance between
  two cities.  For example, if it is asked the difference between a
  and g on the given map, it should determine that the shortest route
  is 19 furlongs:
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-solution.png">
  
 
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>I have provided some code to get started.  You don't have to use it,
  but if you do, the FIXME comments indicate places where you will need
  to add or modify code. 
  </p>
 
 <p>Road map descriptions look like this:</p>
 <code><pre>#
# This sample map corresponds to the diagram above
# 
a,b,5
a,c,8
b,d,6
c,d,2
d,e,12
d,f,2
e,g,3
f,g,7
 </pre></code>

<p>The input and output in the command or terminal window will look like this: </p>
<code><pre>&gt; python3 routes.py a g sample-map.txt
Distance from a to g is 19.0
</pre></code>

<p>
 In case of a misspelled city, your program will report that it does
 not appear on the map:
  </p>
<code><pre>&gt; python3 routes.py a x sample-map.txt
Destination  x  is not on the map
</pre></code>

<p>It can also cope with cities that are present on the map, but with
  no route between:
  </p>
<code><pre>&gt; python3 routes.py a x sample-map-noreach.txt
You can't get from a to x
</pre></code>

<h1>How to solve it</h1>
  <h2>A strategy</h2>
<p> There are several possible algorithms, but the one I suggest is a
  simple depth-first search using a “single source shortest path”
  approach. This approach finds the shortest distance from a single
  source (the starting city) to <em>all</em> other reachable cities
  using depth-first search.  Here is a step-by-step example for
  finding the distance from city a to city g:
  </p>

  <p>We begin by noting that the distance from city a to city a is
  zero furlongs.</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-initial.png">
  <p>Then we calculate the distances of the neighbors of a.</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-step1.png">
  <p>From each city, we make recursive calls to calculate the distance
  of its neighboring cities.  Suppose the recursive call on city b
  occurs next, so we calculate a distance of 5+6 = 11 for city d. 
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-step2a.png">
  <p>
  Later, a recursive call from city c finds a shorter distance to d:
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-step2b.png">
  <p>When we find a shorter route to a city that has already been
  visited, the new shorter distance becomes the new estimate.  Since
  this could improve estimates of distance for other cities reachable
  from the current city (e.g., any estimates of distancs to e, f, and
  g that we have made using the estimate of 11 furlongs to city d), we
  must again make the recursive calls from the city with the improved
  estimate.</p>
  <p>Using the improved estimate of 10 furlongs from a to d, we obtain
  distances to e and f:
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-step3.png">
  <p>
  Again we have two ways to reach city g. Suppose this time, just by
  luck, we first explore the path going through f, and obtain an
  estimate of 19 for g.
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-step4a.png">
  <p>
  Later we explore the road from e to g. However, it produces a worse
  estimate, 25 furlongs, so we keep the old estimate of 19 and do not
  repeat exploration from city g.
  </p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Routes_files/route-choices-step4b.png">
  <p>This algorithm is not guaranteed to be fast (in the worst case we
  could make four different estimates of the distance to city g, and
  with a more complicated road map we might explore every city many
  times).  Better algorithms, which you will learn later if you
  continue to take CIS courses, propagate distance
  estimates in a similar way but may visit cities in an order
  that differs from depth-first search.</p>

   <h2>From strategy to code</h2>
   <p>Expressing the above strategy in Python code depends a lot on
   how the road map and the current estimates of distance are
   represented.  The starter code represents the road map in a
   variable <kbd>roads</kbd> as a
   dictionary.  The sample map above would be represented this way:
</p>
<code><pre>{
   'a': [('b', 5.0), ('c', 8.0)],
   'c': [('a', 8.0), ('d', 2.0)],
   'b': [('a', 5.0), ('d', 6.0)],
   'e': [('d', 12.0), ('g', 3.0)],
   'd':  [('b', 6.0), ('c', 2.0), ('e', 12.0), ('f', 2.0)],
   'g': [('e', 3.0), ('f', 7.0)],
   'f': [('d', 2.0), ('g', 7.0)]
}
</pre></code>
<p>Consider for example if we inquire about roads from city a, that is
 <kbd>roads["a"]<kbd>. We would obtain a list of connections and
   distances in this form:</kbd></kbd></p>
<code><pre>  [('b', 5.0), ('c', 8.0)]
</pre></code>
<p>The first element of this list is a tuple <kbd>('b', 5.0)</kbd>.  A
   tuple can be “deconstructed”  (that is, separated into
   its components) with a Python assignment statement to multiple
   variables. For example, if we write<br>
  <kbd>to_city, dist = ('b', 5.0)</kbd><br>
  the value 'b' will be stored in <kbd>to_city</kbd> and the value 5.0
   will be stored in <kbd>dist</kbd>.  Your textbook also explains the
   Python tuple type.
</p>

<p>Note that each road is represented twice.  For example, the road
   between a and b is represented as a road from a to b and as a road
   from b to a, both with the same distance 5.0. </p>

<p>In addition to the road map, your program will need to keep its
current estimates of distance to each city.  This can easily be done
using a Python dictionary structure, with city names as keys and
estimated distances as values.  In the starter code, I have used the
variable <kbd>distances</kbd> to store these estimates.  Note that if
a city has not yet been visited, it will not appear in the distances
dict.  If it is still not in the distances dict after exploring all
cities reachable from the start city, there must not be any path from
the start city to the destination.
</p>

<p>
I've provided quite a bit of <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/routing/routes.py">starter code</a>
with this project, so you
can concentrate on function dfs.
</p>

<p>In addition to the starter code, I've provided a few road maps.
<a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/routing/ME-distances.txt">ME-distances.txt</a> is taken from a
set of distance estimates found 
online.  Distances in ME-distances.txt are in hours on horseback,
rather than furlongs, but that doesn't matter.
<a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/routing/sample-map.txt">sample-map.txt</a> is the
map used as an example above;
<a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/routing/sample-map-noreach.txt">sample-map-noreach.txt</a> is a variation
that adds a pair of cities x and y that are not reachable from
anywhere else.
<a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/routing/skip-map.txt">skip-map.txt</a> is a map in which the shortest paths are
not the most direct paths.  This may be useful in testing your program
to make sure it is finding the shortest distance rather than finding
the route with the smallest number of steps.
</p>

<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>In computer science and software development, we usually
characterize the efficiency of an algorithm or program as a function
of problem size, reasoning about the <em>worst possible</em> case. If
you consider the depth first search in this regard, it is easy to
construct a worst case that, for <em>n</em> cities and <em>2n</em>
roads, explores <em>2<sup>n</sup></em> paths before it finally finds
the shortest path.  (Convince yourself by constructing a map with 5
cities that could take up to 32 steps.)  We say it the algorithm is <em>exponential</em> in
the number of cities.  That's bad.</p>
<p>There are much, much better algorithms, but they are a little more
complicated.  If you have finished implementing the simple depth-first
search, and would like to try implementing one of the more efficient
algorithms, drop a note on Piazza and I'll provide some guidance on
implementing a better search algorithm.
</p>

<p><em>
<a name="furlongs">Aside</a>: Furlongs are an ancient measure of
distance, used originally by the Roman Empire and based on how long a
person could walk in an hour. In most of the world they have long ago
been replaced by SI measures.  In the U.S. they are still a legal
measure, although the length of a furlong varies slightly from state
to state.  This is a crazy way to measure anything, but not much
crazier than feet, inches, ounces, and miles.</em></p>

   A program that does not compile and run (e.g., because of a syntax error) 
  starts with 0 points for functional correctness, but the grader at his or her
